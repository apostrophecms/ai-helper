# Changelog

## 1.0.0-beta.3 (2023-08-03)

Fixed a bug in the "variants" feature caused by premature PNG to JPEG
conversion. This now happens only when inserting into the media library.

## 1.0.0-beta.2 (2023-05-26)

Convert imported PNGs to JPEGs as this is more appropriate to web
delivery of AI-generated, often realistic images. Reduces image
download time to the browser by at least 80%.

## 1.0.0-beta (2023-04-27)

Initial beta release.
